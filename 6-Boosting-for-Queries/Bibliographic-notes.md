The boosting algorithm (Figure 6.1) is a variant of AdaBoost algorithm of Schapire and Singer [78]. See Schapire [77] for an excellent survey of boosting, and the textbook “Boosting” by Freund and Schapire [79] for a thorough treatment. The private boosting algorithm covered in this section is due to Dwork et al. [32], which also contains the base generator for linear queries. This base generator, in turn, relies on the syntheticizer of Dwork et al. [28]. In particular, Theorem 6.7 comes from [28]. Dwork, Rothblum, and Vadhan also addressed differentially private boosting in the usual sense.
