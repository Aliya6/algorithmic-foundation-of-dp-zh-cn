Randomized Response is due to Warner [84] (predating differential privacy by four decades!). The Laplace mechanism is due to Dwork et al. [23]. The exponential mechanism was invented by McSherry and Talwar [60]. Theorem 3.16 (simple composition) was claimed in [21]; the proof appearing in Appendix B is due to Dwork and Lei [22];
McSherry and Mironov obtained a similar proof. The material in Sec-tions 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 is taken almost verbatim from Dwork et al. [32].\text{Pr}ior to [32] composition was modeled informally, much as we did for the simple composition bounds. For specific mechanisms applied on a single database, there are “evolution of confidence” arguments due to
Dinur, Dwork, and Nissim [18, 31], (which pre-date the definition of differential privacy) showing that the privacy parameter in k-fold com- √k position need only deteriorate like k if we are willing to tolerate a (negligible) loss in δ (for k < 1/ε2). Theorem 3.20 generalizes those arguments to arbitrary differentially private mechanisms.The claim that without coordination in the noise the bounds in the composition theorems are almost tight is due to Dwork, Naor, and Vadhan [29]. The sparse vector technique is an abstraction of a tech- nique that was introduced, by Dwork, Naor, Reingold, Rothblum, and Vadhan [28] (indicator vectors in the proof of Lemma 4.4). It has subsequently found wide use (e.g. by Roth and Roughgarden [74], Dwork, Naor, Pitassi, and Rothblum [26], and Hardt and Rothblum [44]). In our presentation of the technique, the proof of Theorem 3.23 is due to Salil Vadhan.
